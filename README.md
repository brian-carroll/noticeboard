Noticeboard with email notifications

This is an extension of the Rails Tutorial Sample Application.
Any two users can post messages to each other on a shared noticeboard.
The web app emails you when your contact posts a message.
You follow a link in the email to go to the noticeboard and post a message back.

That's all folks!
